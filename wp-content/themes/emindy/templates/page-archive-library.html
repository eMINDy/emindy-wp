<!--
Template: Complete Archive

This template powers the all‑in‑one archive page at /archive-library/.  It
pulls in the `emindy/archive-library` pattern which lists videos,
exercises, articles and blog posts in separate sections.  To use this
template, create a page with the slug “archive-library” and assign
it accordingly.  Users can search across all content and filter by topic.
