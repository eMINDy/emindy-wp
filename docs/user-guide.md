User Guide

Welcome to the eMINDy mental wellness platform! This guide will walk you through the features of the eMINDy website and how to use them to get the most out of your experience. eMINDy offers a variety of resources – from quick exercises and videos to informative articles and self-assessment tools – all designed to help you practice mindfulness and improve your mental well-being. This guide is intended for end-users of the site (visitors) and assumes no technical knowledge.

Navigation and Language Selection

Visiting the Site: When you arrive at the eMINDy homepage, you'll see a calm, inviting design. The top of the page features the main navigation menu:

Home: Clicking the eMINDy logo or site name takes you back to the homepage from anywhere.

Exercises: A section for guided practice exercises. These are short how-to activities like breathing exercises or guided meditations.

Videos: A section with quick videos on various wellness topics and practices.

Articles: A blog-like section with articles, tips, and personal stories about mental health and mindfulness.

Assessments: The place to find self-check quizzes (like mood or anxiety questionnaires).

(You may also see other menu items like “About” or “Start Here” depending on the site setup; these would offer introductory information.)

Language Switcher: eMINDy is bilingual. In the top-right corner of the site header, you'll find a language selector. By default it might show a dropdown with language names (e.g., “English” and “فارسی” for Persian).

Click the dropdown and select your preferred language. The page will refresh in that language. All site interface text and content (where translations are available) will appear in the chosen language.

You can switch languages at any time. eMINDy will remember your selection as you browse, and even specific content has translations. For example, if you’re reading an article in English and switch to Persian (and that article has a Persian version), it will take you directly to the Persian version of that article.

The language switcher does not use flags (to avoid confusion); it lists language names. In Persian view, the site layout will adjust to right-to-left orientation automatically for comfortable reading.

Search: Next to the language switcher is a search icon (a magnifying glass). Click it to open the search bar:

Type any keyword (e.g., “stress” or “sleep”) and press Enter. You’ll get a list of search results across all content types (videos, exercises, articles that match).

In search results, the keywords you searched for will be highlighted in context
GitHub
, so you can see how they appear in each result.

You can click on any result to go to that content. If you want to refine your search, you can use the search form on the results page to try a different term.

The search is a quick way to find content on a specific topic or with specific words without browsing through menus.

Dark Mode Toggle: Also in the top menu (usually rightmost) is a moon icon (🌙). This is the dark mode toggle:

Clicking it will switch the site into Dark Mode (a dark background with light text, easier on the eyes at night or in low light).

Click again (it may change to a sun icon) to switch back to Light Mode.

Your preference is remembered, so if you prefer dark mode, the site will continue in dark mode on your next pages.

This mode affects the color scheme but not functionality – choose whichever is most comfortable for your reading.

Content Sections
Exercises (Guided Practices)

Under Exercises, you will find a library of short guided practices. These are usually interactive or follow-along activities you can do in real time:

Browsing Exercises: The Exercises page (or “Exercise Library”) presents a list of exercises. Each entry shows a title, a brief description, and possibly an indication of duration (like “5 min”).

You can filter or search within exercises by topic or duration. For instance, at the top of the Exercises list, you might see a dropdown to filter by Topic (such as Anxiety, Sleep, Focus) or Technique (like Breathing, Visualization). Selecting one will refresh the list to show only exercises matching that category.

Exercise Page Layout: When you click on an exercise, you'll go to that exercise’s page. At the very top will be the Guided Practice Player
GitHub
:

You’ll see the exercise title and maybe a subtitle or short intro.

A control panel with a Start button (or “Begin”) and possibly Next/Previous if the exercise has multiple steps.

A progress indicator showing the current step number and total steps, plus a timer for the current step and total time remaining
GitHub
.

Below that, there is a list of steps or instructions. As you click Start, the player will highlight each step and potentially play audio or simply count down time for that step. For example, it might say “Step 1/3: Breathe in – 4 seconds” and count down, then “Step 2/3: Hold – 2 seconds,” etc., guiding you through the process.

You can use Next/Previous to navigate steps manually if needed, and a Reset button to restart the exercise
GitHub
.

This interactive player allows you to follow along at your own pace. If at any point you need to pause or want to repeat a step, you can control it.

The steps are also listed in text form (usually right below or alongside the player) in an ordered list
GitHub
. This is helpful if you want to read the instructions or if the interactive part is not accessible to you – you can read and perform the steps manually.

Tips and Additional Info: After the step-by-step player, some exercises pages include extra content like tips, variations, or a short explanation of why this exercise helps. It’s worth scrolling down after finishing to see if there’s a reflection prompt or resource links.

Try it out: We encourage you to try the exercises as you read them. They are usually just a few minutes long. For example, an exercise “1-Minute Breathing Reset” will literally take one minute to do. The idea is to integrate these tiny practices into your day whenever you need them.

Who are they for? Each exercise might note a level or use-case. For instance, it could say “Level: Beginner – Use case: Before Sleep”. That tells you it’s great for anyone (even if new to mindfulness) and specifically helpful to do at bedtime.

You don’t need any special equipment unless noted. Some exercises might mention in the description if you need a quiet space or any props (like “a comfortable chair” or “pen and paper” for a journaling exercise).

Videos

Under Videos, you have a collection of short videos focusing on mental wellness topics:

Browsing Videos: The Video Library page shows video thumbnails with titles (and maybe duration). These could be things like “Progressive Muscle Relaxation (3 min)” or “Dealing with Morning Anxiety”.

There is often a search bar or filter on the Videos page too. For example, you can filter by Topic to only see videos about “Stress Relief” or by Duration if you only have e.g. 2 minutes.

Video Page Layout: Clicking on a video entry will take you to its page:

At the top, the video is embedded and ready to play. It uses a privacy-enhanced YouTube embed (meaning it won’t track you until you hit play). You can click the play button to watch within the page.

Just below the video, there might be a short description or key takeaways from the video.

Chapters: If the video is a bit longer or covers multiple sub-topics, you’ll see a Chapters list under the video
GitHub
. These are like bookmarks or segments:

Each chapter will have a title and maybe a timestamp. For example, a video “10-minute meditation” might have chapters like “0:00 Introduction”, “2:00 Breathing Technique”, “5:00 Body Scan”, etc.

You can click on a chapter to jump to that part of the video (the video player will seek to that time).

Chapters help you navigate or revisit specific parts of the video without watching the whole thing. They’re also listed so you know what content is covered.

After chapters, you may find additional content:

A transcript of the video (especially if it’s informational, there might be a written transcript for accessibility or for you to read if you prefer).

Related links or resources (e.g., if the video talks about a technique, they might link to an exercise or article on that topic).

Watching Tips: Videos will have sound (some are guided audio-visual meditations). Ensure your sound is on if needed. If you are in a quiet environment, you can also rely on captions (most videos have captions you can toggle in the player).

Videos are generally short (most under 5 or 6 minutes). They are meant to be actionable or insightful snippets, not lengthy lectures.

Articles

Under Articles, you’ll find written posts that you can read at your own pace:

Browsing Articles: The Articles section might look like a blog. Posts are usually listed newest first, with their title, a snippet or excerpt, and date.

You might also filter articles by category or topic. For example, you could click on a topic like “Sleep” to see all articles tagged with sleep.

Article Page Layout: Click on an article to read it:

You’ll see the title at top, the author name and publish date (so you know how recent it is).

Then the content of the article. This could be a few paragraphs to a longer read (some might be 500 words, others 1500 – depending on topic).

Articles often cover subjects like personal growth tips, explanations of anxiety or stress, success stories, or deep-dives into a practice’s benefits. They are textual, so take your time to read.

They may include images or infographics to illustrate points.

Some articles might have sections or subheadings if it’s a list or step-by-step guide.

Embedded Content: At times, an article might embed a video or exercise. For example, an article about “Better Sleep” might embed a short breathing exercise or link to a video on sleep techniques. These will either appear inline or as obvious links/buttons (“Try this 2-minute exercise now”).

Comments: Depending on the site, the commenting may be off (often eMINDy doesn’t have open comments to keep the focus). If comments are enabled on an article, feel free to share your thoughts or questions. The community or authors might respond. Keep discourse respectful and on-topic.

Sharing: If you find an article helpful, you can share it via your social networks or email. There might be share buttons (like a Twitter or Facebook icon) either at top or bottom of the article, or you can copy the URL from your browser – it’s a public link.

Related Content: At the end of each article, eMINDy will often show Related Articles or Posts
GitHub
. These are suggestions of other content you might like, usually on a similar topic. For instance, after an article on dealing with panic attacks, it might recommend an exercise for panic grounding or a video on breathing techniques. This is a great way to continue your exploration.

Newsletter Prompt: You might also see a prompt to subscribe to the newsletter at the bottom of an article (something like “Enjoyed this article? Join our weekly Calm Circle newsletter for more tips.”). More on the newsletter below.

Self-Assessments (Quizzes)

The Assessments page hosts tools like the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) and GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) self-assessments:

What are these? They are short questionnaires commonly used in mental health to gauge your mood (PHQ-9 for depressive symptoms) or anxiety levels (GAD-7 for anxiety). These are educational check-ins, not diagnoses.

Taking a Quiz: On the Assessments page, you’ll see options to take the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Possibly they are listed with a brief description:

PHQ-9: “A 9-question self-check for your mood over the last 2 weeks.”

GAD-7: “A 7-question self-check for anxiety over the last 2 weeks.”

Click the one you want to take. It may either expand right there or take you to a dedicated quiz page.

Quiz Interface: Each quiz presents a series of statements, and you choose an answer for how often you’ve experienced each:

For example, PHQ-9’s first item: “Little interest or pleasure in doing things.” And options like “Not at all,” “Several days,” “More than half the days,” “Nearly every day.”

You will see all questions listed one after another
GitHub
GitHub
. Answer each by selecting the radio button that applies to you.

At the bottom, there is a Submit button (often labeled something like “See my result”)
GitHub
.

Confidentiality: Your responses are not sent to a server when you click Submit – the scoring is done within your browser for privacy. Only when you choose to share or save the result is anything sent (and even then, just the final score, not your individual answers).

Viewing Results: After clicking Submit:

The page will show your score out of the maximum (e.g., “Score: 8/27 – Mild” for PHQ-9) along with a short explanation of the severity band
GitHub
GitHub
.

You’ll see a note clarifying that this is not a diagnosis, just a check. It will also prompt something like “If you ever feel unsafe or in crisis, visit the Emergency page” (which likely links to emergency resources)
GitHub
.

The categories generally are:

PHQ-9: 0-4 Minimal depression, 5-9 Mild, 10-14 Moderate, 15-19 Moderately Severe, 20-27 Severe.

GAD-7: 0-4 Minimal anxiety, 5-9 Mild, 10-14 Moderate, 15+ Severe.

So your result will fall into one of those. The page might not list all categories, just yours, but it will say e.g. “Mild” meaning some symptoms but manageable.

What to do with result: The result page may offer recommendations:

It might say “Consider trying our stress relief exercises or talking to a friend if you scored in this range” for mild cases.

For higher scores, it might gently suggest considering professional help or more coping strategies.

Always remember these tools are for reflection. If you find your scores are moderate or high and you haven’t already, you might want to seek guidance from a healthcare provider. eMINDy might have a line like “This is not a diagnosis; if you have concerns, please consult a professional.”

Saving/Sharing Results: On the result display, you will see a few buttons
GitHub
:

Print/Save PDF: This allows you to print the results page or save it as PDF. Useful if you want a personal record or to share with a therapist.

Copy Summary: This copies a plain text summary to your clipboard (score and note) that you can paste somewhere or save.

Get Shareable Link: Clicking this will generate a special URL that contains your score (but not your name or answers)
GitHub
. You can share this link with, say, a counselor or friend if you want them to see your result. Only someone with the exact link can see it, and it doesn’t reveal your identity.

Email me the summary: You can input your email and the site will send your result summary to you
GitHub
. This is convenient if you want to keep it for later in your inbox. (Note: The site limits how often you can email results to prevent spam – about 5 times per hour max
GitHub
).

These quizzes can be retaken anytime (mental state can change week to week). eMINDy might suggest doing these self-checks periodically to track your progress.

Language & Quizzes: If you take it in Persian, the questions and results will be in Persian. The scoring and actions are the same. Ensure if you share a link from Persian view, the recipient also sees it properly – the link itself includes language context so they should see the Persian result page too if the site is configured for that.

Newsletter Subscription

Throughout the site, you might see invitations to join the eMINDy Calm Circle Newsletter:

What is it? The Calm Circle newsletter is a weekly (for example) email that eMINDy sends with a short mindful practice, a tip or story, and updates on new content. It’s a way to stay engaged and get bite-sized wellness reminders in your inbox.

How to subscribe: There’s a dedicated Newsletter page (likely accessible via menu or from prompts). On that page:

You’ll find a sign-up form asking for your Email and optionally your Name
GitHub
.

There’s also a required checkbox like “I agree to receive weekly email updates…” – tick that to give consent
GitHub
.

Click Subscribe.

You should immediately see a confirmation message on the page (something like “Thank you! Please check your inbox.”)
GitHub
.

Double opt-in: eMINDy currently uses single opt-in with explicit consent checkbox. This means after hitting subscribe, you’re already on the list. They will send a welcome email right away
GitHub
.

Check your email after a minute; the welcome email might have a nice greeting, maybe links to a “start here” exercise or a popular 60-second practice.

If you don’t see the email, check spam/junk folder. The sender will likely be something like “eMINDy Team” or similar.

Privacy: The site stores your email and name securely (in their database) and promises not to share it. You won’t get anything other than the intended wellness emails.

Unsubscribe: Every newsletter email will include an unsubscribe link or instructions (e.g., “click here to unsubscribe”). If you decide you no longer want the emails, you can use that at any time and your address will be removed from the list.

Frequency & Content: Typically, expect one email per week. Each email might contain:

A quick mindful exercise of the week (written out or linked to site content).

A brief article or thought for reflection.

Notifications of any new video/exercise/article on eMINDy that week.

Possibly community updates or upcoming events if any.
The tone is encouraging and calm – meant to give you a positive boost.

Language of emails: Currently, the newsletter is likely in English (if the site primarily communicates in English). They might add localized newsletters in future, but assume English unless you know they started a Persian edition. Regardless, site content linked in the email is available in both languages on the site.

Multilingual Support and RTL Layout

For Persian (Farsi) users:

The entire interface flips to an RTL (Right-to-Left) layout when Persian is selected
GitHub
. This means menus align right, text is right-aligned, etc., providing a natural reading experience.

All content should be translated. So you will find the exercises instructions in Persian, video subtitles in Persian (or at least descriptions), and articles fully translated.

Some terminology might remain in English if it’s a name (e.g., PHQ-9 acronym might still be PHQ-9, but questions are in Persian).

If you notice any part not translated (like an odd English word), it could be that translation is pending or it’s a proper noun. The eMINDy team actively works on polishing translations.

Using the site in Persian should feel native. If you prefer content in English while using Persian UI, you can switch on a per-content basis by toggling language – but generally, stick to one language for consistency, because related content suggestions try to stay in the same language.

Accessibility and Tips for Use

Accessibility: The site is designed to be accessible:

You can navigate via keyboard (press Tab to jump to links, Enter to activate; there’s a “Skip to content” link at top if using keyboard to skip repetitive menu links).

Videos have captions available (click the CC button on the video player).

Many images in articles have alt text (for screen readers).

The color contrast is tested for visibility (including dark mode).

If you use a screen reader, the interactive exercise controls have appropriate labels (e.g., the play button announces itself properly).

If you encounter any accessibility issue, the team likely has contact info to report it (in About or footer).

Using eMINDy effectively:

Set aside a few minutes each day or week to explore. For example, each morning you might do a 2-minute exercise from eMINDy to set a positive tone.

Save your favorite resources. You can bookmark specific exercises or videos.

Combine formats: Read an article for knowledge, then try a related exercise to apply that knowledge.

If you subscribe to the newsletter, treat it as a weekly challenge or check-in.

Engage with self-assessments periodically (maybe monthly) to see if your scores improve as you practice more mindfulness.

Use the content when needed: feeling anxious? Search “anxiety” and try what comes up (like a breathing video or an article on managing anxiety).

If you’re in a low moment, the site’s calm design and easy exercises can be a quick refuge – even the act of taking a deep breath along with an exercise player can help ground you.

Emergency Resources: eMINDy might have a page or link called “Emergency” (especially mentioned around quiz results). That page would list crisis hotlines, professional resources, etc. If you ever feel in crisis, use those resources (don’t wait for an email reply or something, directly reach out to emergency help).

Community and Contributions: If eMINDy offers any community features (comments, forums, etc.), be respectful and supportive. It’s a safe space for sharing experiences.

Privacy: No login is required on eMINDy for consuming content. You can use it anonymously. Only the newsletter asks for email. Self-assessment results are not stored server-side with your identity. So feel secure to use the tools honestly for yourself.

Remember, eMINDy is a tool to aid your well-being journey. It is not a replacement for professional mental health care, but it is a valuable complement. Use it to learn new coping skills, to relax and refocus during tough days, and to reinforce positive habits. The platform is here for you 24/7 – whether it's a quick breathing exercise at 3 AM or a motivational article on a Sunday afternoon. Enjoy and take care of yourself!
